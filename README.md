## Homework - 3
This homework required us to reproduce the provided page as closely as possible. We were not allowed to use any frameworks and required us to do it with **HTML, CSS** only. Some of the effects used in the webpage were parallax effects, zooming in and out of images, changing the colour of the images, etc. All these effects needed to be achieved with just CSS.

## Homework - 4
This homework consisted of writing a **HTML/Javascript** program that takes a JSON URL as input which contains Container Shipping Information, the program then **parses the JSON file** and extracts the list of Container Shipping Companies, and displays them in a formatted table. All of the parsing and formatting is done with the help of Javascript that is embedded in HTML. It can be executed in any browser. It also handles the various error cases that can be present in a JSON.

## Homework - 6
This homework required us to use **PHP and Javascript** and create a webpage that allows us to search for events information using **TicketMaster APIs**, and the results will be displayed in tabular format.The page also provides more details for the selected event.  

## Homework - 8
This homework required the use of **Node.js, AngularJS, Amazon Web Services, Twitter API, Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, HTML5** to build a webpage that displays events information, and deatails for a selected event. It involved the usage of TicketMaster API for Autocompletion and for getting events data in JSON format. We also made use of the HTML5 local storage to store event favourites, implement auto refresh and forced refresh functions for these saved events. This homework required us to make a Responsive Web Site (Using Bootstrap) that would automatically scale with the devices (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).

## Homework - 9
This homework required us to use **Android Application Development** to replicate the functionality of Homework - 8 in a mobile app. We were given the choice of an Android or an iOS app. I replicated the functionality in an Android app.
